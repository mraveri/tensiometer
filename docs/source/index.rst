Tensiometer
==================================

tensiometer is a python package to test the level of agreement/disagreement between different posterior distributions.

In order to do so the package contains a set of tools implementing machine learning methods to boost classic statistical inference.

The code is distributed under GNU-GPL license at `github <https://github.com/mraveri/tensiometer>`_.

The best place to start is by looking at the worked examples below.
